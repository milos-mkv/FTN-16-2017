For the textures to show up properly in fbx and blender files, you must place the textures folder and the files in the 
same directory. This is usually the default file structure of all the packages we provide. [Important]


BLENDER FILE:
-The blender file is the native file where the model is created. You can edit the model or its materials and shaders 
here. If textures do not show up, go to file > external data > find missing files > locate the textures folder.


FBX FILE:
-The fbx file is provided for convenience. It is provided with two poses usually: normal and t-pose. If the textures do
not show up, follow the same thing as for blender file.


OPTIMIZED FBX FILE:
-This fbx file is provided with less material and textures for better optimization. Everything required is provided inside
the folder, no extra textures or items required.


TEXTURES FOLDER:
-The textures folder contains all the textures for the model and its accessories.


VRM FILE:
-The vrm file can be used for virtual youtubing purposes. It is setup with full body & facial tracking as well as with cloth & hair
physics.


GAME READY UNITY PACKAGE: (Provided only for Original models)
-The unity game-ready package is provided for use in games. This package is only available for avatars that can be used 
commercially. Just drag and drop prefab to your scene and add colliders and other stuffs to the character and you are 
good to go. If you want any of the avatars purchased to be super-optimized, contact us through our website, we charge a
small fee of about $25 or more for the service.


VRCHAT READY UNITY PACKAGE:
-The unity VRChat ready package is setup for use in VRChat.
It is setup with Full body tracking, eye-tracking, lip-syncing, cloth & hair physics and facial expressions (gestures).
In order to use cloth or hair physics, you must have dynamic bone asset purchased from the asset store and imported into
your project before importing the vrchat package.

If you want to increase your avatar performance, you can try to delete some dynamic bone components (physics component) 
in the hair & clothing.

To edit cloth and hair physics movement values. Go to character heirachy > armature > find hair transform or cloth 
transform which has dynamic bone component (physics component) attached to it. Go to the component & edit its values. 
You can also remove the components if you don't want physics.

Facial expressions have been overriden in the avatar through gestures. You don't have to do anything. Just upload and Enjoy!


***To Use VRChat-ready package: Create a fresh unity project in unity 2018.4.20f1. Import the dynamic bone asset into 
the project. (If you want to use cloth and hair physics). Import VRChat ready package in that project. Open the 
scene file or drag the vrchat prefab into your scene. > Select character in the scene and upload.

Dynamic bone asset is 3rd party asset and can be purchased from the unity assetstore. It gives realistic physics on hair,
cloth, breasts etc.
